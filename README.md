# ditafmx-2-issues
Report and track DITA-FMx issues

There is no code in this repository. Its sole purpose it to provide a reporting and tracking mechanism for the DITA-FMx plugin.

- [Create a new issue](https://github.com/leximation/ditafmx-2-issues/issues/new)
- [Review existing issues](https://github.com/leximation/ditafmx-2-issues/issues)

An "issue" may be anything you'd like to see changed, added, or improved in DITA-FMx. Bugs or serious problems will be addressed as soon as possible, and other items may become new features in a future update.

A GitHub account is required to create a new issue. If you don't have one and don't want to register, just report your issue to [leximation.com](http://leximation.com/contact.php) and we'll add it here for you.

*Note: Using a GitHub repo for issue tracking is a bit of an experiment; [let us know what you think](http://leximation.com/contact.php).*
